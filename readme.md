# KerjaAja
KerjaAja is a job marketplace application designed to help individuals find work by posting job listings based on job category. Inspired by medieval/fantasy RPG games, the app features a job board in the home page where job owners can post quests or job listings, and users can accept the job and then work out the details and payment through the app's chat feature. The app will focus on helping Indonesians find work, from basic tasks like cleaning and helping out, to more advanced jobs such as creating e-commerce applications. The goal of the app is to make it easier for people to find work and for those youngsters with specific talents, such as coding or design, to earn money and gain experience.
